We choose only the best produce for Only Organic – certified organic ingredients that we completely trust. It’s real food grown on organic farms to give your little gourmet the best possible start. WHEN TO START SOLIDS Until the age of around six months ALL baby’s nutrition comes from breast milk or infant formula. Paediatricians usually recommend that you start offering solid foods when your little one reaches 6 months old though some babies may be ready as early as 4 months. Babies are born with a store of iron that starts to deplete at around six months so it is important that breast milk or infant formula are complemented with rice cereal that 6 added iron as well as a range of pureed meats and vegetables. Vegetables have Vitamin C, which helps iron absorption. The introduction of solid foods to your baby's diet or weaning is an exciting milestone. In addition to breast milk or baby formulas, weaning will allow your baby to take in other essential nutrients including vitamins and minerals to help support healthy growth and development. SIGNS THAT YOUR BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDS -As your baby watches you eat with great fascination and even makes attempts to grab your food... this is a sure sign of interest and he/she is definitely gearing up for the weaning process. Other signals of readiness to wean includes: Your baby is able to hold his head up -Forward tongue thrust or extrusion reflex has disappeared so he can take food from a spoon and swallow it (if baby is still poking their tongue out, this means they are not quite ready for solids). Watches you eat and becomes very excited when they see food. Chewing movements even though probably no teeth yet. Remember to offer your baby milk feed first, wait a little while, and then offer a small amount of new food. HOW TO INTRODUCE SOLIDS - Offer Only Organic Baby Rice Cereal as baby’s very first food. Mix one teaspoon with a little breast milk or formula to a thin custard consistency. If using breast milk it may go watery as breast milk has enzymes, which break down the starches in rice cereal. -Sit baby on your lap with baby’s right arm tucked behind you and holding baby’s left arm with your left hand. Reverse the position if you are left-handed. Offer half to one teaspoon the first day. The next day increase by one to two teaspoons and so on until baby has one to two tablespoons a day. After a week or so offer another new food, for example, pureed pumpkin, in the same way at a different time of day so that baby has rice cereal once a day plus a taste of a new food. -Babies’ appetites vary from day to day so expect that they will eat different amounts on different days. Check with your child health nurse as to the number of breast feeds or bottles of infant formula that your baby needs at this stage With sun-ripened bananas slow cooked with juicy New Zealand apples and blended to a velvety smooth puree, Only Organic Banana & Apple Pouch is perfect to kickstart the weaning process. Simply serve on its own or make a fruity rice porridge mixing it with Baby Rice and your baby’s usual milk. To Serve: Delicious straight from the pouch. Squeeze onto your baby's spoon or into a clean bowl. To serve warm, stand open pouch in hot water or decant contents into a microwave proof bowl. Remember to always check temperature before serving to your baby. Note to parents: Do not microwave pouch. Discard uneaten heated meal.","[8706, 10100747, 8718, 8722]",1970627860,979 sold,RedMart,1000008313,24204,Only Organic,Singapore

We choose only the best produce for Only Organic – certified organic ingredients that we completely trust. It’s real food grown on organic farms to give your little gourmet the best possible start. WHEN TO START SOLIDS Until the age of around six months ALL baby’s nutrition comes from breast milk or infant formula. Paediatricians usually recommend that you start offering solid foods when your little one reaches 6 months old though some babies may be ready as early as 4 months. Babies are born with a store of iron that starts to deplete at around six months so it is important that breast milk or infant formula are complemented with rice cereal that 6 added iron as well as a range of pureed meats and vegetables. Vegetables have Vitamin C, which helps iron absorption. The introduction of solid foods to your baby's diet or weaning is an exciting milestone. In addition to breast milk or baby formulas, weaning will allow your baby to take in other essential nutrients including vitamins and minerals to help support healthy growth and development. SIGNS THAT YOUR BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDS -As your baby watches you eat with great fascination and even makes attempts to grab your food... this is a sure sign of interest and he/she is definitely gearing up for the weaning process. Other signals of readiness to wean includes: Your baby is able to hold his head up -Forward tongue thrust or extrusion reflex has disappeared so he can take food from a spoon and swallow it (if baby is still poking their tongue out, this means they are not quite ready for solids). Watches you eat and becomes very excited when they see food. Chewing movements even though probably no teeth yet. Remember to offer your baby milk feed first, wait a little while, and then offer a small amount of new food. HOW TO INTRODUCE SOLIDS - Offer Only Organic Baby Rice Cereal as baby’s very first food. Mix one teaspoon with a little breast milk or formula to a thin custard consistency. If using breast milk it may go watery as breast milk has enzymes, which break down the starches in rice cereal. -Sit baby on your lap with baby’s right arm tucked behind you and holding baby’s left arm with your left hand. Reverse the position if you are left-handed. Offer half to one teaspoon the first day. The next day increase by one to two teaspoons and so on until baby has one to two tablespoons a day. After a week or so offer another new food, for example, pureed pumpkin, in the same way at a different time of day so that baby has rice cereal once a day plus a taste of a new food. -Babies’ appetites vary from day to day so expect that they will eat different amounts on different days. Check with your child health nurse as to the number of breast feeds or bottles of infant formula that your baby needs at this stage With sun-ripened bananas slow cooked with juicy New Zealand apples and blended to a velvety smooth puree, Only Organic Banana & Apple Pouch is perfect to kickstart the weaning process. Simply serve on its own or make a fruity rice porridge mixing it with Baby Rice and your baby’s usual milk. To Serve: Delicious straight from the pouch. Squeeze onto your baby's spoon or into a clean bowl. To serve warm, stand open pouch in hot water or decant contents into a microwave proof bowl.

We choose only the best produce for Only Organic – certified organic ingredients that we completely trust. It’s real food grown on organic farms to give your little gourmet the best possible start. WHEN TO START SOLIDS Until the age of around six months ALL baby’s nutrition comes from breast milk or infant formula. Paediatricians usually recommend that you start offering solid foods when your little one reaches 6 months old though some babies may be ready as early as 4 months. Babies are born with a store of iron that starts to deplete at around six months so it is important that breast milk or infant formula are complemented with rice cereal that 6 added iron as well as a range of pureed meats and vegetables. Vegetables have Vitamin C, which helps iron absorption. The introduction of solid foods to your baby's diet or weaning is an exciting milestone. In addition to breast milk or baby formulas, weaning will allow your baby to take in other essential nutrients including vitamins and minerals to help support healthy growth and development. SIGNS THAT YOUR BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDS -As your baby watches you eat with great fascination and even makes attempts to grab your food... this is a sure sign of interest and he/she is definitely gearing up for the weaning process. Other signals of readiness to wean includes: Your baby is able to hold his head up -Forward tongue thrust or extrusion reflex has disappeared so he can take food from a spoon and swallow it (if baby is still poking their tongue out, this means they are not quite ready for solids). Watches you eat and becomes very excited when they see food. Chewing movements even though probably no teeth yet. Remember to offer your baby milk feed first, wait a little while, and then offer a small amount of new food. HOW TO INTRODUCE SOLIDS - Offer Only Organic Baby Rice Cereal as baby’s very first food. Mix one teaspoon with a little breast milk or formula to a thin custard consistency. If using breast milk it may go watery as breast milk has enzymes, which break down the starches in rice cereal. -Sit baby on your lap with baby’s right arm tucked behind you and holding baby’s left arm with your left hand. Reverse the position if you are left-handed. Offer half to one teaspoon the first day. The next day increase by one to two teaspoons and so on until baby has one to two tablespoons a day. After a week or so offer another new food, for example, pureed pumpkin, in the same way at a different time of day so that baby has rice cereal once a day plus a taste of a new food. -Babies’ appetites vary from day to day so expect that they will eat different amounts on different days. Check with your child health nurse as to the number of breast feeds or bottles of infant formula that your baby needs at this stage With sun-ripened bananas slow cooked with juicy New Zealand apples and blended to a velvety smooth puree, Only Organic Banana & Apple Pouch is perfect to kickstart the weaning process. Simply serve on its own or make a fruity rice porridge mixing it with Baby Rice and your baby’s usual milk. To Serve: Delicious straight from the pouch. Squeeze onto your baby's spoon or into a clean bowl. To serve warm, stand open pouch in hot water or decant contents into a microwave proof bowl. Remember to always check temperature before serving to your baby. Note to parents: Do not microwave pouch.

They’re made from pure, premium ingredients and have a soft texture and delicious taste. With a variety of cereal and fruit and vegetable purees, you have a range of flavours to tempt your baby on their first foods adventure. We choose only the best produce for Only Organic – certified organic ingredients that we completely trust. It’s real food grown on organic farms to give your little gourmet the best possible start. WHEN TO START SOLIDS Until the age of around six months ALL baby’s nutrition comes from breast milk or infant formula. Paediatricians usually recommend that you start offering solid foods when your little one reaches 6 months old though some babies may be ready as early as 4 months. Babies are born with a store of iron that starts to deplete at around six months so it is important that breast milk or infant formula are complemented with rice cereal that 6 added iron as well as a range of pureed meats and vegetables. Vegetables have Vitamin C, which helps iron absorption. The introduction of solid foods to your baby's diet or weaning is an exciting milestone. In addition to breast milk or baby formulas, weaning will allow your baby to take in other essential nutrients including vitamins and minerals to help support healthy growth and development. SIGNS THAT YOUR BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDS -As your baby watches you eat with great fascination and even makes attempts to grab your food... this is a sure sign of interest and he/she is definitely gearing up for the weaning process. Other signals of readiness to wean includes: Your baby is able to hold his head up -Forward tongue thrust or extrusion reflex has disappeared so he can take food from a spoon and swallow it (if baby is still poking their tongue out, this means they are not quite ready for solids). Watches you eat and becomes very excited when they see food. Chewing movements even though probably no teeth yet. Remember to offer your baby milk feed first, wait a little while, and then offer a small amount of new food. HOW TO INTRODUCE SOLIDS - Offer Only Organic Baby Rice Cereal as baby’s very first food. Mix one teaspoon with a little breast milk or formula to a thin custard consistency. If using breast milk it may go watery as breast milk has enzymes, which break down the starches in rice cereal. -Sit baby on your lap with baby’s right arm tucked behind you and holding baby’s left arm with your left hand. Reverse the position if you are left-handed. Offer half to one teaspoon the first day. The next day increase by one to two teaspoons and so on until baby has one to two tablespoons a day. After a week or so offer another new food, for example, pureed pumpkin, in the same way at a different time of day so that baby has rice cereal once a day plus a taste of a new food. -Babies’ appetites vary from day to day so expect that they will eat different amounts on different days. Check with your child health nurse as to the number of breast feeds or bottles of infant formula that your baby needs at this stage With sun-ripened bananas slow cooked with juicy New Zealand apples and blended to a velvety smooth puree, Only Organic Banana & Apple Pouch is perfect to kickstart the weaning process. Simply serve on its own or make a fruity rice porridge mixing it with Baby Rice and your baby’s usual milk. To Serve: Delicious straight from the pouch. Squeeze onto your baby's spoon or into a clean bowl. To serve warm, stand open pouch in hot water or decant contents into a microwave proof bowl. Remember to always check temperature before serving to your baby. Note to parents: Do not microwave pouch. Discard uneaten heated meal.","[8706, 10100747, 8718, 8722]",1970627860,979 sold,RedMart,1000008313,24204,Only Organic,Singapore

We choose only the best produce for Only Organic – certified organic ingredients that we completely trust. It’s real food grown on organic farms to give your little gourmet the best possible start. WHEN TO START SOLIDS Until the age of around six months ALL baby’s nutrition comes from breast milk or infant formula. Paediatricians usually recommend that you start offering solid foods when your little one reaches 6 months old though some babies may be ready as early as 4 months. Babies are born with a store of iron that starts to deplete at around six months so it is important that breast milk or infant formula are complemented with rice cereal that 6 added iron as well as a range of pureed meats and vegetables. Vegetables have Vitamin C, which helps iron absorption. The introduction of solid foods to your baby's diet or weaning is an exciting milestone. In addition to breast milk or baby formulas, weaning will allow your baby to take in other essential nutrients including vitamins and minerals to help support healthy growth and development. SIGNS THAT YOUR BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDS -As your baby watches you eat with great fascination and even makes attempts to grab your food... this is a sure sign of interest and he/she is definitely gearing up for the weaning process. Other signals of readiness to wean includes: Your baby is able to hold his head up -Forward tongue thrust or extrusion reflex has disappeared so he can take food from a spoon and swallow it (if baby is still poking their tongue out, this means they are not quite ready for solids). Watches you eat and becomes very excited when they see food. Chewing movements even though probably no teeth yet. Remember to offer your baby milk feed first, wait a little while, and then offer a small amount of new food. HOW TO INTRODUCE SOLIDS - Offer Only Organic Baby Rice Cereal as baby’s very first food. Mix one teaspoon with a little breast milk or formula to a thin custard consistency. If using breast milk it may go watery as breast milk has enzymes, which break down the starches in rice cereal. -Sit baby on your lap with baby’s right arm tucked behind you and holding baby’s left arm with your left hand. Reverse the position if you are left-handed. Offer half to one teaspoon the first day. The next day increase by one to two teaspoons and so on until baby has one to two tablespoons a day. After a week or so offer another new food, for example, pureed pumpkin, in the same way at a different time of day so that baby has rice cereal once a day plus a taste of a new food. -Babies’ appetites vary from day to day so expect that they will eat different amounts on different days. Check with your child health nurse as to the number of breast feeds or bottles of infant formula that your baby needs at this stage With sun-ripened bananas slow cooked with juicy New Zealand apples and blended to a velvety smooth puree, Only Organic Banana & Apple Pouch is perfect to kickstart the weaning process. Simply serve on its own or make a fruity rice porridge mixing it with Baby Rice and your baby’s usual milk. To Serve: Delicious straight from the pouch. Squeeze onto your baby's spoon or into a clean bowl. To serve warm, stand open pouch in hot water or decant contents into a microwave proof bowl. Remember to always check temperature before serving to your baby. Note to parents: Do not microwave pouch. Discard uneaten heated meal.","[8706, 10100747, 8718, 8722]",1970627860,979 sold,RedMart,1000008313,24204,Only Organic,Singapore

We choose only the best produce for Only Organic – certified organic ingredients that we completely trust. It’s real food grown on organic farms to give your little gourmet the best possible start. WHEN TO START SOLIDS Until the age of around six months ALL baby’s nutrition comes from breast milk or infant formula. Paediatricians usually recommend that you start offering solid foods when your little one reaches 6 months old though some babies may be ready as early as 4 months. Babies are born with a store of iron that starts to deplete at around six months so it is important that breast milk or infant formula are complemented with rice cereal that 6 added iron as well as a range of pureed meats and vegetables. Vegetables have Vitamin C, which helps iron absorption. The introduction of solid foods to your baby's diet or weaning is an exciting milestone. In addition to breast milk or baby formulas, weaning will allow your baby to take in other essential nutrients including vitamins and minerals to help support healthy growth and development. SIGNS THAT YOUR BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDS -As your baby watches you eat with great fascination and even makes attempts to grab your food... this is a sure sign of interest and he/she is definitely gearing up for the weaning process. Other signals of readiness to wean includes: Your baby is able to hold his head up -Forward tongue thrust or extrusion reflex has disappeared so he can take food from a spoon and swallow it (if baby is still poking their tongue out, this means they are not quite ready for solids). Watches you eat and becomes very excited when they see food. Chewing movements even though probably no teeth yet. Remember to offer your baby milk feed first, wait a little while, and then offer a small amount of new food. HOW TO INTRODUCE SOLIDS - Offer Only Organic Baby Rice Cereal as baby’s very first food. Mix one teaspoon with a little breast milk or formula to a thin custard consistency. If using breast milk it may go watery as breast milk has enzymes, which break down the starches in rice cereal. -Sit baby on your lap with baby’s right arm tucked behind you and holding baby’s left arm with your left hand. Reverse the position if you are left-handed. Offer half to one teaspoon the first day. The next day increase by one to two teaspoons and so on until baby has one to two tablespoons a day. After a week or so offer another new food, for example, pureed pumpkin, in the same way at a different time of day so that baby has rice cereal once a day plus a taste of a new food. -Babies’ appetites vary from day to day so expect that they will eat different amounts on different days. Check with your child health nurse as to the number of breast feeds or bottles of infant formula that your baby needs at this stage With sun-ripened bananas slow cooked with juicy New Zealand apples and blended to a velvety smooth puree, Only Organic Banana & Apple Pouch is perfect to kickstart the weaning process. Simply serve on its own or make a fruity rice porridge mixing it with Baby Rice and your baby’s usual milk. To Serve: Delicious straight from the pouch. Squeeze onto your baby's spoon or into a clean bowl. To serve warm, stand open pouch in hot water or decant contents into a microwave proof bowl. Remember to always check temperature before serving to your baby. Note to parents: Do not microwave pouch. Discard uneaten heated meal.","[8706, 10100747, 8718, 8722]",1970627860,979 sold,RedMart,1000008313,24204,Only Organic,Singapore

We choose only the best produce for Only Organic – certified organic ingredients that we completely trust. It’s real food grown on organic farms to give your little gourmet the best possible start. WHEN TO START SOLIDS Until the age of around six months ALL baby’s nutrition comes from breast milk or infant formula. Paediatricians usually recommend that you start offering solid foods when your little one reaches 6 months old though some babies may be ready as early as 4 months. Babies are born with a store of iron that starts to deplete at around six months so it is important that breast milk or infant formula are complemented with rice cereal that 6 added iron as well as a range of pureed meats and vegetables. Vegetables have Vitamin C, which helps iron absorption. The introduction of solid foods to your baby's diet or weaning is an exciting milestone. In addition to breast milk or baby formulas, weaning will allow your baby to take in other essential nutrients including vitamins and minerals to help support healthy growth and development. SIGNS THAT YOUR BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDS -As your baby watches you eat with great fascination and even makes attempts to grab your food... this is a sure sign of interest and he/she is definitely gearing up for the weaning process. Other signals of readiness to wean includes: Your baby is able to hold his head up -Forward tongue thrust or extrusion reflex has disappeared so he can take food from a spoon and swallow it (if baby is still poking their tongue out, this means they are not quite ready for solids). Watches you eat and becomes very excited when they see food. Chewing movements even though probably no teeth yet. Remember to offer your baby milk feed first, wait a little while, and then offer a small amount of new food. HOW TO INTRODUCE SOLIDS - Offer Only Organic Baby Rice Cereal as baby’s very first food. Mix one teaspoon with a little breast milk or formula to a thin custard consistency. If using breast milk it may go watery as breast milk has enzymes, which break down the starches in rice cereal. -Sit baby on your lap with baby’s right arm tucked behind you and holding baby’s left arm with your left hand. Reverse the position if you are left-handed. Offer half to one teaspoon the first day. The next day increase by one to two teaspoons and so on until baby has one to two tablespoons a day. After a week or so offer another new food, for example, pureed pumpkin, in the same way at a different time of day so that baby has rice cereal once a day plus a taste of a new food. -Babies’ appetites vary from day to day so expect that they will eat different amounts on different days. Check with your child health nurse as to the number of breast feeds or bottles of infant formula that your baby needs at this stage With sun-ripened bananas slow cooked with juicy New Zealand apples and blended to a velvety smooth puree, Only Organic Banana & Apple Pouch is perfect to kickstart the weaning process. Simply serve on its own or make a fruity rice porridge mixing it with Baby Rice and your baby’s usual milk. To Serve: Delicious straight from the pouch. Squeeze onto your baby's spoon or into a clean bowl. To serve warm, stand open pouch in hot water or decant contents into a microwave proof bowl. Remember to always check temperature before serving to your baby. Note to parents: Do not microwave pouch.

We choose only the best produce for Only Organic – certified organic ingredients that we completely trust. It’s real food grown on organic farms to give your little gourmet the best possible start. WHEN TO START SOLIDS Until the age of around six months ALL baby’s nutrition comes from breast milk or infant formula. Paediatricians usually recommend that you start offering solid foods when your little one reaches 6 months old though some babies may be ready as early as 4 months. Babies are born with a store of iron that starts to deplete at around six months so it is important that breast milk or infant formula are complemented with rice cereal that 6 added iron as well as a range of pureed meats and vegetables. Vegetables have Vitamin C, which helps iron absorption. The introduction of solid foods to your baby's diet or weaning is an exciting milestone. In addition to breast milk or baby formulas, weaning will allow your baby to take in other essential nutrients including vitamins and minerals to help support healthy growth and development. SIGNS THAT YOUR BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDS -As your baby watches you eat with great fascination and even makes attempts to grab your food... this is a sure sign of interest and he/she is definitely gearing up for the weaning process. Other signals of readiness to wean includes: Your baby is able to hold his head up -Forward tongue thrust or extrusion reflex has disappeared so he can take food from a spoon and swallow it (if baby is still poking their tongue out, this means they are not quite ready for solids). Watches you eat and becomes very excited when they see food. Chewing movements even though probably no teeth yet. Remember to offer your baby milk feed first, wait a little while, and then offer a small amount of new food. HOW TO INTRODUCE SOLIDS - Offer Only Organic Baby Rice Cereal as baby’s very first food. Mix one teaspoon with a little breast milk or formula to a thin custard consistency. If using breast milk it may go watery as breast milk has enzymes, which break down the starches in rice cereal. -Sit baby on your lap with baby’s right arm tucked behind you and holding baby’s left arm with your left hand. Reverse the position if you are left-handed. Offer half to one teaspoon the first day. The next day increase by one to two teaspoons and so on until baby has one to two tablespoons a day. After a week or so offer another new food, for example, pureed pumpkin, in the same way at a different time of day so that baby has rice cereal once a day plus a taste of a new food. -Babies’ appetites vary from day to day so expect that they will eat different amounts on different days. Check with your child health nurse as to the number of breast feeds or bottles of infant formula that your baby needs at this stage With sun-ripened bananas slow cooked with juicy New Zealand apples and blended to a velvety smooth puree, Only Organic Banana & Apple Pouch is perfect to kickstart the weaning process. Simply serve on its own or make a fruity rice porridge mixing it with Baby Rice and your baby’s usual milk. To Serve: Delicious straight from the pouch. Squeeze onto your baby's spoon or into a clean bowl. To serve warm, stand open pouch in hot water or decant contents into a microwave proof bowl. Remember to always check temperature before serving to your baby. Note to parents: Do not microwave pouch. Discard uneaten heated meal.","[8706, 10100747, 8718, 8722]",1970627860,979 sold,RedMart,1000008313,24204,Only Organic,Singapore

We choose only the best produce for Only Organic – certified organic ingredients that we completely trust. It’s real food grown on organic farms to give your little gourmet the best possible start. WHEN TO START SOLIDS Until the age of around six months ALL baby’s nutrition comes from breast milk or infant formula. Paediatricians usually recommend that you start offering solid foods when your little one reaches 6 months old though some babies may be ready as early as 4 months. Babies are born with a store of iron that starts to deplete at around six months so it is important that breast milk or infant formula are complemented with rice cereal that 6 added iron as well as a range of pureed meats and vegetables. Vegetables have Vitamin C, which helps iron absorption. The introduction of solid foods to your baby's diet or weaning is an exciting milestone. In addition to breast milk or baby formulas, weaning will allow your baby to take in other essential nutrients including vitamins and minerals to help support healthy growth and development. SIGNS THAT YOUR BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDS -As your baby watches you eat with great fascination and even makes attempts to grab your food... this is a sure sign of interest and he/she is definitely gearing up for the weaning process. Other signals of readiness to wean includes: Your baby is able to hold his head up -Forward tongue thrust or extrusion reflex has disappeared so he can take food from a spoon and swallow it (if baby is still poking their tongue out, this means they are not quite ready for solids). Watches you eat and becomes very excited when they see food. Chewing movements even though probably no teeth yet. Remember to offer your baby milk feed first, wait a little while, and then offer a small amount of new food. HOW TO INTRODUCE SOLIDS - Offer Only Organic Baby Rice Cereal as baby’s very first food. Mix one teaspoon with a little breast milk or formula to a thin custard consistency. If using breast milk it may go watery as breast milk has enzymes, which break down the starches in rice cereal. -Sit baby on your lap with baby’s right arm tucked behind you and holding baby’s left arm with your left hand. Reverse the position if you are left-handed. Offer half to one teaspoon the first day. The next day increase by one to two teaspoons and so on until baby has one to two tablespoons a day. After a week or so offer another new food, for example, pureed pumpkin, in the same way at a different time of day so that baby has rice cereal once a day plus a taste of a new food. -Babies’ appetites vary from day to day so expect that they will eat different amounts on different days. Check with your child health nurse as to the number of breast feeds or bottles of infant formula that your baby needs at this stage With sun-ripened bananas slow cooked with juicy New Zealand apples and blended to a velvety smooth puree, Only Organic Banana & Apple Pouch is perfect to kickstart the weaning process. Simply serve on its own or make a fruity rice porridge mixing it with Baby Rice and your baby’s usual milk. To Serve: Delicious straight from the pouch. Squeeze onto your baby's spoon or into a clean bowl. To serve warm, stand open pouch in hot water or decant contents into a microwave proof bowl. Remember to always check temperature before serving to your baby. Note to parents: Do not microwave pouch. Discard uneaten heated meal.","[8706, 10100747, 8718, 8722]",1970627860,979 sold,RedMart,1000008313,24204,Only Organic,Singapore
